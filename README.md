We are dedicated to dismantling greed and overcoming the limitations of capitalism by providing technology and solutions that remove barriers and empower the most underserved in our communities. We strive to foster an inclusive environment and welcome all non-discriminating groups and people to join our mission. Our focus is on empowering and supporting individuals and organizations to harness and foster their capabilities and skills. We are committed to creating opportunities that enable self-sufficiency and sustainability that encourage equitable access to technology for those who need it most.

Our hope to to become an established 501(3)c and to offer our highly sought-after skills to those who serve our communities and those most in need. We see non-profits in our communities as our heroes we wish to show you our gratitude by supporting you the only way we know how. So here's to making something for people who want nothing.
